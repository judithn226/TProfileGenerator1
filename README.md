# Team Profile Generator

### Description

One of the most important aspects of programming is writing code that is readable, reliable, and maintainable. Oftentimes, _how_ we design our code is just as important as the code itself. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, you will also be ensuring that all unit tests pass.

## User Story

```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```

## APP Demo
